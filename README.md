# AI_Friend 🤖  
An AI-inspired conversational companion built with modern frontend tools.

## Overview
**AI_Friend** is an interactive chat-style application designed to simulate an AI companion experience.  
The project focuses on clean architecture, scalable UI, and AI-ready design patterns suitable for integrating NLP/LLM backends.

This repository is intended to demonstrate my ability to build AI-facing applications, structure production-ready code, and design user experiences around intelligent systems.

## Key Features
- Conversational chat interface
- Message state management
- Modular and scalable component structure
- AI-integration–ready architecture
- Cross-platform support (Android, iOS, Web)

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React Native, Expo
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **State Management:** React Hooks
- **Tooling:** Expo CLI, npm

## AI / ML Relevance
While this project does not train models directly, it is designed as a **client interface for AI systems**, making it suitable for:
- Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Connecting to REST / streaming AI APIs
- Experimenting with prompt-based conversational systems
- Building user-facing products around ML services
